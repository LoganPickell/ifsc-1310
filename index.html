    <h2> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of Progressive Enhancement design approach emphasizes building applications or websites with a basic accessible foundation. When the foundation is set, then advanced functionality can be added. This will give users with modern browsers and devices to be able to access more features. This approach allows users with that are not able to access these features still have a pleasurable experience, because of the solid foundation that was set. I think this is important as we implement more and more advanced technology, we still need to be able to have accessible content to everyone. Not every single person has access the latest and greatest techonology.</p>

    <p>As a basketball and baseball player, I was always taught about fundamentals. This ties in as well. The foundation must be set. The fundamentals must be learned before extra flair can be added. The fundamentals of dribbling must be learned before attempting behind the back, or between the legs. The foundation of the website should be set before additional advanced features.</p>
